    <h4>Some of the things I will try to cover as best I can is:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Psychology. Individual to group psychology. From the narcissistic, socio- and psychopathic personalities types
            (lust for power, The age old trait of human greed, etc), to the psychology of people that are highly driven by
            empathy, fear, anger, etc - traits that have shown themselves throughout the ages, at various levels of
            influence and at various levels of society at large. While I am no expert in these fields, we all understand
            these behaviours to one degree or another due to life experience. Some of these things people may or may not
            identify in themselves.
            There are organizations and institutions that have access to an unfathomable amounts of research on this.
            Many people are blissfully unaware of how vulnerable they are to manipulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Technological advancements throughout the ages and how, no matter who developed them or how they were/are used,
            funded, marketed, etc., every tool/discovery can be used for good and for bad. It is the intent of the
            benefactors of it's use, that makes all the difference.
            My go to 3 step metaphor here (Those who know me, know how I love a metaphor) is:
            If I have a hammer in my hand, I can build somethin with it or I can end a life with it.
            My intentions are what matters in that context.
            The invention of the wheel has been the basis for delivering goods and people around the world.
            Sometimes this was food aid to starving populations.
            Sometimes it was trafficking children across borders.
            The wheel facilitated both.
            Nuclear energy has the ability to provide cheap, safe, relatively clean energy to a massive amount of people.
            But also has the ability to wipe many of them off of the planet.
            
            The last one I will add there is a far more recent one. And a pretty contentious one. AI.
            But we will approach that in another episode.

            The monetary system. I have a lot of holes in my knowledge on this one. But what I have learnt so far already
            raises many questions about such core historical moments, that I think the average person (if they were honest
            with themselves) would have to at least wonder if what they were taught in the past was completely true.
