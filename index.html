      <h2>Introduction & Disclaimer:</h2>
      <p>To the few people who have been waiting for months now, for me to get this channel started,
        I hope that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>&#40;A&#41; It lives up to expectations,</li>
        <li>&#40;B&#41; That it manages to help some people at least make some sense of this crazy world we live in.</li>
        <li>&#40;C&#41; We can hopefully we can get more people aware of how much we have all been lied to and manipulated, a lot of it to keep us at each other's throats and not recognizing the common problems we all share.</li>
        <li>&#40;D&#41; And lastly, that I can spark some sort of fire in people to help them recognize that looking for a hero (be they a person or organization) is an exercise in desperation that will leave you with a knife in your back.
          <span class="line-break">Your family, friends and community are the only ones that can help you when the chips are down and we all need to realize that really quickly.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was very hesitant to start a channel at first. <p>I knew then and still fully comprehend now that there is A LOT that I am completely ignorant of.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the internet is already full of people who are trying to tell you
        what to think. I am not one of those people. My purpose here is to elucidate what I see happening and for you to make up
        your own mind. I am no expert in any field so I wont be offended if someone completely discounts what I say.
        But while I still (sort of) have it, I will use my chance to put my views out there and see what people think.
        That is all this channel is.
        See disclaimer in the beginning.

          What I hope to do - as best I can - is show my views not simply on the sensationalist side of events about certain islands and who went there and such (although those allegations and information around them will be pertinent at some point),
          but to try to highlight where I see a common pattern that shows similar characteristics, that has simply evolved over time. A very long time indeed.
        </p>
        <h4>Some of the things I will try to cover as best I can is:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Psychology. Individual to group psychology. From the narcissistic, socio- and psychopathic personalities types (lust for power, The age old trait of human greed, etc), to the psychology of people that are highly driven by empathy, fear, anger, etc - traits that have shown themselves throughout the ages, at various levels of influence and at various levels of society at large. While I am no expert in these fields, we all understand these behaviours to one degree or another due to life experience. Some of these things people may or may not identify in themselves.
            There are organizations and institutions that have access to an unfathomable amounts of research on this.
            Many people are blissfully unaware of how vulnerable they are to manipulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technological advancements throughout the ages and how, no matter who developed them or how they were/are used, funded, marketed, etc., every tool/discovery can be used for good and for bad. It is the intent of the benefactors of it's use, that makes all the difference.
            My go to 3 step metaphor here (Those who know me, know how I love a metaphor) is:
            If I have a hammer in my hand, I can build somethin with it or I can end a life with it.
            My intentions are what matters in that context.
            The invention of the wheel has been the basis for delivering goods and people around the world.
            Sometimes this was food aid to starving populations.
            Sometimes it was trafficking children across borders.
            The wheel facilitated both.
            Nuclear energy has the ability to provide cheap, safe, relatively clean energy to a massive amount of people.
            But also has the ability to wipe many of them off of the planet.

            The last one I will add there is a far more recent one. And a pretty contentious one. AI.
            But we will approach that in another episode.
          </li>
          <li>
            The monetary system. I have a lot of holes in my knowledge on this one. But what I have learnt so far already raises many questions about such core historical moments, that I think the average person (if they were honest with themselves) would have to at least wonder if what they were taught in the past was completely true.
          </li>
            
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        
        It is these complex ideas, the psychology, science and technology, politics, money/influence behind them, where we can
        see parallels in history, etc. All these things I feel are important to understand now more than ever, that I will
        discuss in these videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        If someone disagrees with me or thinks I am incorrect on something, please feel free to leave a comment or otherwise my
        other contact links will be below and in the channel’s profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        To conclude this intro and disclaimer, I just want to explain a little of my world view in a bullet point type form to
        give everyone a basic idea of who is talking here:
      </p>
      <p>
        
        I am no bigot of any kind, and if someone claims that I am, I am pretty certain they have misunderstood my point. I have
        experienced and learnt enough in my life to realize that the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn really does hold true:”The
        line of good and evil runs through the heart of every man”.That applies across ethnicities, religions and ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        I have been betrayed by people that look and believe very similar things to me as well as being helped by the same group
        of people while having the same experience with people who do not look like me or believe what I believe.
        I sincerely mean no harm to any person or group of people and my aim is to help people make sense of the utter madness
        we see around us today.
