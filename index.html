      <h1>Episode 1</h1>
      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>To the few people who have been waiting for months now, for me to get this channel started,
        I hope that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>&#40;A&#41; It lives up to expectations,</li>
        <li>&#40;B&#41; That it manages to help some people at least make some sense of this crazy world we live in and,</li>
        <li>&#40;C&#41; That I am not too late and that hopefully we can get more people aware of how much we have all been lied to and manipulated,</li>
        <li>&#40;D&#41; And lastly, that I can spark some sort of fire in people to help them recognize that looking for a hero (be they a person or organization) is an exercise in desperation that will leave you with a knife in your back. Your family, friends and community are the only ones that can help you when the chips are down and we all need to realize that really quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>

      <p>
        I was very hesitant to start a channel at first. <p>I knew then and still fully comprehend that I do not know everything.
        Not by a long shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the internet is already full of people who are trying to tell you
        what to think. I am not one of those people. My purpose here is to elucidate what I see happening and for you to make up
        your own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I want to explain to people (as best I can) is not simply conspiratorial, sensationalist nonsense.
        I will try to show where I see how the age old trait of human greed, narcissistic and sociopathic/psychopathic lust for
        power - traits that have shown themselves throughout the ages, at various levels of influence - combined with
        technological advancements the world has never seen before, can lead to an extremely unstable and precarious system of a
        severely detached and parasitic elite, an mostly indoctrinated middle class clambering to keep what they can (if they
        are smart or getting into debt if they aren’t so clued up), and a poor so desperate that their frustration and anger can
        be used and managed for uprisings and unrest if needed.
      </p>
      <p>

        It is these complex ideas, the psychology, science and technology, politics, money/influence behind them, where we can
        see parallels in history, etc. All these things I feel are important to understand now more than ever, that I will
        discuss in these videos.
      </p>
      
      If someone disagrees with me or thinks I am incorrect on something, please feel free to leave a comment or otherwise my
      other contact links will be below and in the channel’s profile.
      
      To conclude this intro and disclaimer, I just want to explain a little of my world view in a bullet point type form to
      give everyone a basic idea of who is talking here:
      
      I am no bigot of any kind, and if someone claims that I am, I am pretty certain they have misunderstood my point. I have
      experienced and learnt enough in my life to realize that the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn really does hold true:”The
      line of good and evil runs through the heart of every man”.That applies across ethnicities, religions and ideologies.
      
      I have been betrayed by people that look and believe very similar things to me as well as being helped by the same group
      of people while having the same experience with people who do not look like me or believe what I believe.
      I sincerely mean no harm to any person or group of people and my aim is to help people make sense of the utter madness
      we see around us today.</p>
